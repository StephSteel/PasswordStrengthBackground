# Password Strength Background

Password Strength Background is a simple web application that demonstrates the concept of changing the background blur based on the strength of a password entered by the user. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive user interface.


## Features

- **Interactive Background:** The application features a background image that blurs as the user types in their password, creating a visual representation of password strength.

- **Password Strength Indicator:** The background blur intensity changes based on the strength of the entered password. Stronger passwords result in a less blurry background, while less stronger passwords result in a blurrier background.
